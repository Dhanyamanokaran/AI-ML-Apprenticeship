## ðŸ“… Day-wise Progress

### **Day 1 â€” Setup & GitHub Basics**
- Installed Python, pip, Jupyter Notebook, and Git.
- Created folder: `Day1_Setup`.
- First notebook: `day1_intro.ipynb`.
- Ran first code:
```python
print("Hello AI World! My apprenticeship begins.")


### **Day 2 â€” Python & NumPy Basics**

Python Dictionary:
Created and accessed values.
Python Function:
square_numbers(numbers) to return squares of numbers.
    
NumPy Basics:
Created 1D and 2D arrays.
Sliced arrays (first 6 and last 5 elements).
Calculated sum, mean, std, and row sums.
Element-wise addition and dot product.
Committed & pushed notebook to GitHub.


### **Day-3 - Day 3 â€” Pandas & Data Handling

Created DataFrame from a dictionary.
Selected columns and filtered rows:
df["Name"]
Rows where StudyHours > 5
First 3 rows

Calculated basic statistics
.mean(), .max(), .sum()
Added new column TotalHours.
Updated column values using .loc.
Saved DataFrame to CSV and read it back.
